Last updated: 24/06/2024

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Metadata Bot ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our Discord bot.

## 2. Information We Collect and Use

We collect minimal user data:

- Basic error logs.
- Images and any embedded metadata when you react to an image with the :mag: emoji.
- Discord user ID.

This information is used to:

- Provide the Bot's core functionality of displaying image metadata.
- Improve Bot performance and troubleshoot issues.
- Identify the user to send the processed image.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- We do not store user data or message content.
- Images and user IDs are processed in real-time and are not stored beyond the immediate processing required to fulfill your request.
- Error logs are stored in a file solely for troubleshooting purposes.

## 4. User Rights

You have the right to:
- Request information about the data we process related to you.
- Opt-out of bot interactions by removing the bot from your server or blocking it.
- Remove messages processed by the Bot by reacting with the :x: emoji.

## 5. Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access or alteration of the bot.
